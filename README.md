# The-Amazing-Spider-Man-PC-Fix

# Requirements before using fix

You must run the ASMLauncher.exe file and set all the graphics settings you want first (Resolution option here doesn’t matter so pick whatever you want) and launch the game once so these settings are applied. If the ASMLauncher.exe has a memory issue, then simple close the launcher and delete the file VideoDetection.dll so there is no video memory issue anymore. Once you have done all of this and all graphic options you want are set then you will no longer need to run the game via the ASMLauncher.exe anymore and can use game.exe instead.

# Instructions

Go to releases and download the latest TheAmazingSpiderMan.zip, extract the ASM-1-FPS-Patcher.exe, d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files into your game folder next to the Game.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

You will need to run the patcher program only once on a fresh/ clean installation of the game this will uncap fps to 360 perminantly then you can play the game normally.

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio

The default for resolution is set to (1920 x 1080) in the d3d9.ini file. Put the resolution that you wish to use in both the Width and Height area.

Resolution and aspect ratio edits are done together so you will only have to choose your resolution.

# FPS

Before changing FPS inside of the d3d9.ini file you will need to run the ASM-1-FPS-Patcher.exe once which will patch the areas needed to uncap FPS. Once you run this once you do not need to run this again. There is a possibility this file may flag on anti-virus due to the edits that it needs to make to the game, this is a false flag, and you will need to add this to the exception list for your anti-virus.

Once you have used the patcher you can then edit the FPS inside of the d3d9.ini file. The default for FPS is (0) which is uncapped. The max FPS you can go to is 360. You can change it as you wish or fully uncap it to 360 with (0) with the FPSLimit option in the d3d9.ini file.
FOV
The default for FOV is option (3). You can choose either 1,2 or 3 in the d3d9.ini file and each option will increase the FOV in game. If you wish to use the original FOV then simply don’t press the hotkey when playing the game.

The game will start with the original FOV by default and when in game you can press the ‘mouse button 2’ key or whatever hotkey you have chosen in the [hotkey]keycodes.txt file to toggle between the original and new FOV setting.

General note – FOV in this game is very buggy and can break in many areas of the game in particular shadows, terrain, the phone etc so it is advised to only use this for trying it out or fun as it stands.
