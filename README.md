# The-Amazing-Spider-Man-PC-Fix

![ezgif com-animated-gif-maker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e25daed-7274-4dba-87c0-0dca2efe4823)

# Instructions

Go to releases and download the latest The Amazing Spider-Man fix of either TheAmazingSpiderManFix.zip or TheAmazingSpiderManSteamFix.zip, extract the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini files into your game folder next to the Game.exe file and you are good to go! You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file. If a Steam user, you will also have a VideoDetection.dll file which you need to extract into your game folder and (back up always somewhere else) replace the VideoDetection.dll file already in there.
<br><br>

# Resolution/Aspect Ratio

The default for resolution is set to (1920 x 1080) in the d3d9.ini file. Put the resolution that you wish to use in both the Width and Height area.
Aspect Ratio is (3) 16:9 by default in the d3d9.ini file. If you don’t use 16:9 then simply change this to the number correct for you.
<br><br>

# FPS

The fix has done its best to make the frame rate as smooth as possible for everyone. To do this the dll tricks the game into thinking that it is using an older Nvidia graphics card which the game originally ran well on. The default for FPS is still 60.
<br><br>

# FOV

The default for FOV is option (1). You can choose either (1), (2) or (3) in the d3d9.ini file and each option will increase the FOV in game. If you wish to use the original FOV then simply put (0).
This game can have issues with the FOV zoomed out, so a hotkey is added to go between custom FOV and original game FOV. The hotkey can be set in the d3d9.ini file and to choose the key you want you need to copy the key hex code from the [hotkey]keycodes.txt file.
